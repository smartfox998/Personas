It is a device to which bicycles can be securely attached for parking purposes when passengers taking the bus. In this project, we are going to discuss the user experiences of this interface. Some observations about interactions between this interface and real users can be found <a href="#observations">here</a>. The interview questions and interview summary regarding users' experiences with this interface can be found <a href = "#interview">here</a>.</p>

                    <p style="padding-top:5px" class = "section-text-font">When a passenger wants to use the bike rack on the bus, he/she needs to first squeeze the release handle and pull it to low, just as shown in the left image above. One of the key interactive components here is the squeeze handle, passengers can only pull the bike rack down when they squeeze the handle.
                        Then passenger can place the bikeâ€™s wheels in the front truck. Once the bike is mounted, he/she needs to raise the support arm up and over the front tire to make sure the arm is securely placed at the top close to the bike, just as shown in the right image above. Another key interactive component here is the raise support arm, which is used to secure the bike on the rack.
